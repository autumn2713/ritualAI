# The CÃ¦li Project

**CÃ¦li: Your Neurospicy Personal Assistant AI** is a neuroaffirming, AI-powered ritual assistant for focus, flow, and executive function support designed to gently anchor focus, motivation, and executive functionâ€”especially for ADHD and neurodivergent users.

This project is more than a productivity tool. Itâ€™s an *attentive presence*â€”one that helps you return to rhythm, initiate rituals, and honor the tasks that matter most without overwhelm or shame.

### ðŸŒ± Core Philosophy
CÃ¦li is being built on three guiding principles:
- **Structure without rigidity** â€“ flexible scheduling, compassionate accountability
- **Support without surveillance** â€“ no judgment, no productivity obsession
- **Presence without pressure** â€“ it reminds, reflects, and returns you to your path

### âœ¨ Planned Features
- Custom task rituals with supportive reminders
- Push notifications written in gentle, focused tone
- Ritual Mode: immersive, guided focus sessions
- Energy-based scheduling (not just time slots)
- AI voice/messaging that adapts to mood, resistance, and capacity

### ðŸŽ¯ Who Itâ€™s For
- Neurodivergent folks craving structure *that doesnâ€™t punish them*
- People with ADHD, CPTSD, chronic fatigue, or executive dysfunction
- Anyone who wants to feel *accompanied* while organizing their life
